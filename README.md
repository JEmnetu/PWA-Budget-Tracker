# PWA-Budget-Tracker


## About


Web application that tracks user expenses and funds, and displays the information graphically as it is updated. For this assignment, we were given the front end design and tasked with adding functionality to keep track of transactions while offline and re-sync with the database when online.

## Usage

The application is deployed at [this link](https://jh-budgetapp.herokuapp.com/). To use the application simply enter the name and dollar amount of the transaction, and select whether funds are being added or subtracted. Disconnect from the internet and repeat these steps, and then reconnect.
